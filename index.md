## 📰 News: Introducing Plume
_Miguel_ — 2025-10-16 14:11:00

Welcome to **Plume**, a space where short fiction and independent writing meet technology.

## 🪶 What is Plume?

Plume is an iPhone and iPad app designed for readers who love **short stories, microfiction, and literary gems that fit in a coffee break** — and for writers who want to share them freely.

Each story is written in **Markdown**, stored on **GitHub**, and displayed beautifully in the app.  
This makes Plume completely open: readers can explore, and authors can contribute simply by adding a new file.

## 🌍 Why I built it

As a lifelong fan of short stories — from Maupassant to Poe — I wanted a way to rediscover the format in a modern, mobile way.  
Most reading platforms today focus on long novels or paid content.  
Plume is the opposite: **concise, free, and community-driven**.

It’s also a way to celebrate the public domain: many classic short stories will be available directly in the app, remastered in clean Markdown format.

## ✍️ For writers

Writers can publish their own stories easily:
1. Create a `.md` file in the repository under `/stories/author_name/`.
2. Add a short YAML header (title, author, language, etc.).
3. Push it to GitHub — and it appears in the app.

Plume turns GitHub into a living library of fiction.

## 📱 For readers

The app is minimal and distraction-free.  
You can:
- browse stories by date, genre, or author;  
- mark favorites;  
- comment on your favorite authors;  
- and even read offline.  

Every story is short enough to finish on the bus, the train, or before bed.

## 🚀 What’s next

Plume will start with a selection of public-domain classics (Maupassant, Daudet, Poe, and more) and soon open to modern indie authors.  
Later updates will include:
- a “Read later” feature synced via iCloud,  
- weekly highlights,  
- and author profiles.

## ❤️ The spirit of Plume

> *Stories don’t have to be long to leave a mark.*

Plume is about the joy of short words and big emotions.  
If you write, read, or just love the art of storytelling — this app is for you.
