          REPORT OF THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN FOR THE YEAR 1924-25.



      _Laid on the Table of the House of Representatives by Leave._



  THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN to the CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT LIBRARY COMMITTEE.

SIR,--

I have the honour to submit the following report for the year 1924-25:--


                      RECESS LIBRARY COMMITTEE.

The Recess Library Committee, the constitution of which was altered by
resolution passed by both Chambers of the Legislature at the close of
last session, held three meetings during the recess, under the
chairmanship of the Hon. the Speaker of the House of Representatives,
the Hon. Charles E. Statham. Two of these meetings were informal, as a
full quorum was unobtainable. At the third meeting, however, there was
a full quorum, and the business done at the previous meetings was duly
confirmed. In view of the great difficulty which obtains of securing a
quorum at the meetings as called, the question is worth consideration
as to the desirableness of making some slight alteration in the rule
under which the Recess Committee is now constituted.


                      ADDITIONS TO THE LIBRARY.

The number of new accessions since the date of the last report is
2,089, which is lower than that in the previous Library year, the
previous total having been 2,700. This latter, however, includes some
500 volumes of the Herries bequest. Owing to the financial position of
the Library being much better at the end of the financial year, it is
more than probable that next year's report will chronicle a
substantially higher increase.

The various volumes of the Herries bequest have been repaired and
rebound where necessary, and have been added to the shelves in their
respective classes.

The total number of catalogued books and other accessions on the 18th
June was over 109,705--which, in view of the fact of the greatly
enhanced cost of books (the Library vote, L700, being to-day only L100
a year more than it was thirty years ago), must be deemed satisfactory.

Important orders for new books are now in course of execution, the
volumes being due early in this year's session. An attempt has been
made to cover all the more important additions in literature on the
great problems of the day; and, whilst economy has had to be practised,
and a careful selection made of the books and publications generally
which really count, it will, I think, be found that very few works of
outstanding merit and importance have been overlooked.

In accordance with the policy of not clashing with the Alexander H.
Turnbull Library, rare and expensive works of literature dealing with
the early history of New Zealand, Australia, and the Pacific have not
been bought, but all works of recent and current interest on the
Dominion and the Commonwealth, or affecting the various problems of the
Pacific, are regularly added.

Works on various political and social problems continue to be more
specially favoured by members of both branches of the Legislature, to
whom baskets of books are forwarded during the recess. After these,
biography is most in favour.


                            LIBRARY STAFF.

During the greater part of last year's recess the Chief Librarian was
absent in Australia in quest of better health; and he may be pardoned,
I trust, for here expressing his personal gratitude to the Minister in
Charge of the Legislative Department (the Hon. Mr. Nosworthy) and the
then Prime Minister (the Right Hon. W. F. Massey), for the great
consideration and kindness these gentlemen displayed in granting him
the necessary leave of absence.

Until the Chief Librarian's return, early in October, Mr. W. S.
Wauchop, M.A., who in August assumed the duties of First Assistant in
the Library, had charge of the institution, under the Joint Library
Committee. Mr. Wauchop has proved himself a most obliging member of the
staff.


                          RECESS PRIVILEGES.

The number of persons to whom recess privileges were granted during the
recess, 1924-25, was 670, as against 740 in the previous year; the
latter number being exceptionally large owing to the greater length of
the recess in the earlier period.

The number of books lent to recess-privilege holders for the year
1924-25 was 6,135, as against 6,587 in the previous recess period. As a
rule, the class of books taken out by recess-privilege holders (and
here it may be noted that the New Zealand General Assembly Library is
the only legislative library in the world from which volumes may be
taken out during the recess) is of such a character as proves that the
privilege is greatly valued by the best class of readers.

No fiction, it should again be recorded, is lent out save to members of
Parliament, and those on the full-privilege list--a relatively small
number.

A detailed list showing the professions, trades, occupations, &c., of
those to whom the recess privileges are granted is at the disposal of
members.

During the recess, I regret to say, it has been found that a few plates
were purloined from art and other magazines, and cuttings made in the
newspaper files. Whenever a case of this kind is detected, an
attempt--unfortunately up to now abortive--has been made to detect the
offender, and the art magazines are now filed in the staff-room, and
not issued to those who use the Library during the recess, save members
of Parliament. On the whole, however, the cases of vandalism are
exceedingly few, and it gives me pleasure to testify to the care and
good usage which is almost uniformly displayed by those who are
honoured by being granted the recess privileges.


                            STOCK-TAKING.

As usual, stock-taking was proceeded with during the recess, the
classes dealt with being Class 910-919 (Voyages and Travels) and Class
920-929 (Biography, Memoirs, &c.). Mr. W. F. Johnson, who conducted
this particular work with great care, furnishes the following report:--

"I have the honour to report that, with Mr. Dighton, I have completed
the stock-taking of the two classes mentioned above, with results as
follows:--

"Class 910-919 (Voyages and Travels): This class--one of the largest in
the Library--was last taken stock of in the year 1918, when twenty-two
volumes were reported missing. Since that date 419 volumes have been
added to this class, making the total number in this section 5,326. The
result of this stock-taking shows that eleven volumes were
unaccounted-for, a list of which is appended.

"Class 920-929 (Biography, &c.): This class also was last taken in
1918, when fourteen volumes were reported as missing. Since that time
360 volumes have been added to this class, making the total number in
this section 4,157. At this stock-taking the number unaccounted-for is
twenty-two, several of which are quite recent accessions to the
Library. It is difficult to believe that many of these books are lost
to the Library, as, of the fourteen reported lost at last stock-taking,
several were found in their places upon the shelves. The utmost care
has been taken in verifying the stock-sheets with the registers, and
with checking the volumes themselves. A list of books not accounted for
in each class is appended hereto, and I hand you herewith the working
stock-sheets."


                              BINDING.

There must always be a certain degree of wear-and-tear upon the
volumes, either those used during the session or during the recess; and
there are unquestionably a large number of volumes in the Library which
urgently stand in need of being rebound, rebacked, or otherwise
repaired. The number, too, of periodicals of various kinds, the back
numbers of which are of great value to members, has largely increased
of late years, and, as a substantially increased charge is now made for
binding, the annual vote for this purpose is being found markedly
inadequate. A large number of magazines have been withdrawn from the
binding-list, but the enormous increase in the number of books,
periodicals, pamphlets, &c., and the files of newspapers, which
certainly should be bound if the Library is to meet the requirements of
members, has certainly made the position much more serious. In view of
the increased cost of binding, the existing annual vote can only be
regarded as insufficient, and I would respectfully plead for a fairly
substantial increase.


                            MISCELLANEOUS.

The correspondence of the Library has quite materially increased in
volume. Inquiries from all parts of the Dominion for information as to
the value of certain rare books, requests for assistance in literary
matters, and on questions relative to the Copyright Act, have involved
considerable work, Mr. W. F. Johnson having rendered valuable aid in
assisting the Chief Librarian in this matter.

Officials of various State Departments continue to make considerable
use of the Library during the recess, and in several instances have
acknowledged the assistance rendered them in their researches by the
Library staff.

The usual monthly lists of accessions have been sent out during the
recess.

I have to express my thanks to the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the
Joint Library Committee (the Hon. the Speaker of the House of
Representatives and J. McC. Dickson, Esq., M.P.), and to the Chairman
and Deputy Chairman of the Recess Library Committee (the Hon. the
Speaker and the Hon. Dr. Collins, M.L.C.) for the attention these
gentlemen have given the Library matters during the year; also to the
High Commissioner and his staff for the promptitude and care with which
they have attended to Library business in London.

In an appendix will be found the Library balance-sheet for the year
ended 31st March, 1925, together with a copy of the Auditor's

                                      CHARLES WILSON,

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
